        <p>
          Stanly Lau is an Agile Coach in Odd-e. He previously worked as a developer and manager.
          He lives in an environment where IT is seen undervalued and "the only way a developer
          can progress is to become a manager". This could be a reason way many people switch out
          of IT and he nearly got influenced by that. Instead, he searched for better ways on
          software development and that leads him to Agile. From then on, he enjoys helping others
          to produce better quality software in a sustainable way.
          He is particularly interested in engineering practices like Continuous Integration,
          Test Driven Development and Refactoring. He is also focusing on Scrum and yearns to improve
          his facilitation skills so that it helps people effectively.

          Bas Vodde is an experienced coach in agile methods and especially Scrum. He's also a
          Certified Scrum master trainer. Next to Scrum, he trains and coaches teams in TDD,
          retrospective and agile planning. He is originally from Holland, however has lived in
          China, Finland and is currently living in Singapore. In the 90s he worked as a developer
          in Holland and felt a mismatch between what he experienced as working and between "what
          the official literature said you should do". That was solved with the introduction of
          Extreme Programming and evenmore so, with Agile Development in general.
